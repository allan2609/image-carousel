# image-carousel

Assignment from The Odin Project:

Create an image carousel.

It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backward.

It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds.

It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be clickable to advance to that particular slide).
