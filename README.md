# image-carousel

Assignment from The Odin Project:

Create an image carousel. It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backward. It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds. It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be clickable to advance to that particular slide).

Don’t spend too much time worrying about getting your images to display at the correct size – it’s more important to get the carousel rotating.
